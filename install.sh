## Getting Started

Once the server is running and connected to Claude Desktop, you can use natural language queries like:

### Player Lookup Examples
```
Look up Mike Trout's player ID
Find players named Johnson
What is Aaron Judge's career span?
Search for players with last name starting with "Pu"
```

### Statistics Examples
```
Get 2023 batting statistics for players with 500+ plate appearances
Show me Clayton Kershaw's pitching stats from 2020-2023
Compare team batting stats for the Dodgers and Yankees in 2023
What were the top home run hitters in 2022?
```

### Visualization Examples
```
Create a spray chart for Albert Pujols in 2012
Make a comparison chart for Shohei Ohtani and Mike Trout's 2023 batting stats
Generate a heatmap spray chart for Ronald AcuÃ±a Jr. in 2023
Compare Aaron Judge and Giancarlo Stanton's home run distributions
```

## Advanced Queries

### Multi-season Analysis
```
Compare Babe Ruth's stats across his career
Show me how Mike Trout's performance has changed over time
Analyze the evolution of strikeout rates in baseball from 2000-2023
```

### Team Analysis
```
Compare National League vs American League offensive stats for 2023
Show me the best pitching rotations by ERA in 2022
Which teams had the best defensive metrics in 2023?
```

### Historical Data
```
Who were the best players in the deadball era?
Compare modern players to players from the 1990s
Show me World Series MVP performances
```

## Tips for Better Results

1. **Be specific with years**: Always specify the season or year range
2. **Use common player names**: "Mike Trout" works better than "Michael Trout"
3. **Specify qualifiers**: e.g., "minimum 300 plate appearances"
4. **Ask for explanations**: "Explain what WAR means in these results"
5. **Request comparisons**: "Compare these players" or "Show me the differences"

## Troubleshooting

If you get "player not found" errors:
- Try different name formats (e.g., "Last, First" or "First Last")
- Use partial names for fuzzy matching
- Check spelling of player names

If data seems incomplete:
- Verify the season/year is correct
- Some advanced stats only available for recent years (2015+)
- Historical data may be limited for older players
